                Top 4 Dietary Guidlines
            </h1>
            <b1 class="hi">
                Guideline 1:
                <br>
                To achieve and maintain a healthy weight, be physically active and choose amounts of nutritious food and drinks to meet your energy needs
                Children and adolescents should eat sufficient nutritious foods to grow and develop normally. They should be physically active every day and their growth should be checked regularly.
                Older people should eat nutritious foods and keep physically active to help maintain muscle strength and a healthy weight.
                <br>
                <br>
                Guideline 2:
                <br>
                Enjoy a wide variety of nutritious foods from these five groups every day:
                Plenty of vegetables, including different types and colours, and legumes/beans
                Fruit
                Grain (cereal) foods, mostly wholegrain and/or high cereal fibre varieties, such as breads, cereals, rice, pasta, noodles, polenta, couscous, oats, quinoa and barley
                Lean meats and poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, nuts and seeds, and legumes/beans
                Milk, yoghurt, cheese and/or their alternatives, mostly reduced fat (reduced fat milks are not suitable for children under the age of 2 years)
                And drink plenty of water.
                <br>
                <br>
                Guideline 3:
                <br>
                Limit intake of foods containing saturated fat, added salt, added sugars and alcohol
                <br>
                a. Limit intake of foods high in saturated fat such as many biscuits, cakes, pastries,
                pies, processed meats, commercial burgers, pizza, fried foods, potato chips,
                crisps and other savoury snacks. Replace high fat foods which contain predominantly saturated fats such as butter, cream, cooking margarine, coconut and palm oil with foods which contain predominantly polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats such as oils, spreads, nut butters/pastes and avocado.
                Low fat diets are not suitable for children under the age of 2 years.
                <br>
                b. Limit intake of foods and drinks containing added salt.

                Read labels to choose lower sodium options among similar foods.
                Do not add salt to foods in cooking or at the table.
                <br>
                c. Limit intake of foods and drinks containing added sugars such as confectionary, sugar-sweetened soft drinks and cordials, fruit drinks, vitamin waters, energy and
                sports drinks.
                <br>
                d. If you choose to drink alcohol, limit intake. For women who are pregnant, planning a pregnancy or breastfeeding, not drinking alcohol is the safest option.
                <br>
                <br>
                Guideline 4
                <br>
                Care for your food; prepare and store it safely

                Macro-Nutrients and Micro-Nutrients
            </h1>
            <b1 class="hi">
                Macronutrients, or fat, protein, water and carbohydrates, are the nutrients we require in greater amounts to provide us energy. Most micronutrients are vitamins and minerals, which are equally important but only consumed in smaller quantities.

                What are Nutrients?
            </h1>
            <b1 class="hi">
                The foods we eat contain nutrients. Nutrients are substances required by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must be obtained from our diet since the human body can not make them. Nutrients have one or more of three basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure, and/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental surroundings, move, excrete wastes, breathe, grow, and reproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body to function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain non-nutrient that may be harmful such as natural toxins common in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives or beneficial like antioxidants.

            </h1>
            <b1 class="hi">
                Protein - Necessary for tissue formation, cell reparation, and hormone and enzyme production. It is essential for building strong muscles and a healthy immune system.
                <br>
                Carbohydrates - Provide a ready source of energy for the body and provide structural constituents for the formation of cells.
                <br>
                Fat - Provides stored energy for the body, functions as structural components of cells, and signaling molecules for proper cellular communication. It provides insulation to vital organs and works to maintain body temperature.
                <br>
                Vitamins - Regulate body processes and promote normal body-system functions.
                <br>
                Minerals - Regulate body processes, are necessary for proper cellular function, and comprise body tissue.
                <br>
                Water - Transports essential nutrients to all body parts, transports waste products for disposal, and aids with body temperature maintenance.
